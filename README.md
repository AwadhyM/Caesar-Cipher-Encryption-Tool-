# Caesar-Cipher-Encryption-Tool-
Programme that replicates a Caesar-Cipher, whereby a user can encrypt their own message by changing each letter to one further ahead in the alphabet based on shift factor

I really enjoyed creating this project. It was a really useful exercise in project planning, debugging using pry, and strengthening my understanding and application of programming fundamentals.

To improve this project I will in the future add functionality so that it doesn't just run by only calling the method once.
